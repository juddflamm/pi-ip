# pi-ip
This is a Node Module for installing on your Raspberry Pi, so that when it boots up it will report it's IP Address to you, in a cloud hosted Firebase database of your choosing.

Additionally, this module supports being installed on multiple Raspberry Pi's, all with differently configured names.  All Pi IP data will be available in the same Firebase database.

###Setup
On the Pi...
* `cd /etc/`
* `sudo npm install pi-ip`
* 

###Future
Wireless Network Configuration stored in Firebase, and setup on the PI upon bootup using a wired connection, then auto reboot.
